  # Channels used to derive a virtual emg.
  emg_from_lfp:

  # Visually identified in the lfp during the first 2h of recovery sleep
  superficial_ctx:

  # Center of white matter. according to paxinos and watson, this should be ~400um
  # from the pyramidal layer, with lower and upper limits of ~266um and ~533um from
  # the pyramidal layer, respectively.
  white_matter:

  # Identified on the basis of whole-probe csd from during recovery sleep.
  hippocampus:

  # Hippocampal channels, +/- additional channels above and below to allow for drift.
  # this is probably unnecessary, even for animals with a lot of drift.
